# TCGA_AB_Compartments
A/B compartments (open/closed chromatin) for 12 cancer types estimated from TCGA methylation data

## Preprocessing

We preprocessed each methylation cancer dataset separately by using the noob background correction method [[Triche et al. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3627582/)] followed by functional normalization, both implemented in the minfi package.
